Predix Digital Volcano
======================

The Predix Digital Volcano App is a simple reference application demonstrating
the use of Predix Services on the data set collected from industrial sensors
installed in the Masaya Volcano near Nicaragua's capital Managua.

If you've already taken the `Digital Expedition`_ to the center of the active
volcano as part of the story, the documentation here will take you on a
tour of Predix.  View the `Volcano App`_ live demo.
