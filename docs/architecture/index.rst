Architecture
============

This section aims to explain how the application was built in detail so that
you can understand how the components interact with one another to form an
application architecture.

Overview
--------

The Volcano App is designed to run on the **Predix Cloud**.  The Predix Cloud
is running **Cloud Foundry**, a multi-cloud container-based architecture.  The
app could run on top of OpenStack, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Platform, or
as the case with Predix Free Trial accounts -- AWS in the US-West environment.

The application consists of *client* and *server* components that integrate via
RESTful service calls to Predix Micro-Services.
